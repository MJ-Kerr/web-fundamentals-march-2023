  Last Digit of A to the B

  Modern computers can handle very large numbers,
  but this ability has limits. If a number is
  repeatedly multiplied by itself, it eventually
  exceeds the computerâ€™s ability to accurately
  represent it. (Side note: the number of times
  it is multiplied by itself is called the exponent.)

  For an optional end-of-chapter challenge, determine
  the smallest (least significant) digit of a number
  that is potentially very, very large. You may find
  that you must do this without computing the actual
  (unimaginably large) number.

  Implement a function that accepts two non-negative
  integers as arguments. Function lastDigitAtoB(a, b)
  should return the last digit of the first number (a)
  raised to an exponent of the second number (b).

  Examples: given (3, 4) , you should return 1 (the
  last digit of 81: 3 * 3 * 3 * 3). Given (12, 5),
  return 2 (the least significant digit of 248832,
  which is 12 * 12 * 12 * 12 * 12).
